#  canada's largest casino city looking to expand its gaming options, and the toronto blue jays could be one of the beneficiaries

When it comes to casinos, there’s no bigger market in Canada than Toronto. So it’s no surprise that the city is looking to expand its gaming options, a move that could benefit the Toronto Blue Jays.

According to a report from The Globe and Mail, the Ontario Lottery and Gaming Corporation (OLG) is looking into expanding casino gambling beyond the Greater Toronto Area (GTA), with plans to add more casinos and slot machines in smaller cities.

The OLG is said to be eyeing locations such as Hamilton, Kitchener-Waterloo, London and Sudbury for additional gaming venues. This would mark a shift away from the strategy of recent years, which has seen most new casinos built in the GTA.

For the Blue Jays, this could mean an increase in revenue from fans travelling to take part in casino gaming action. It could also lead to an uptick in interest in the team from those living in or near these smaller cities.

Casino gambling is big business in Canada. According to a report from Statistics Canada, Canadians spent $22.5 billion on casino games in 2016, up from $21.2 billion in 2015. That works out to an average of about $1,500 per person.

It’s not just Canadians who are spending big bucks on casino games. Visitors to Canada also contribute their fair share; according to a study by Grant Thornton International Ltd., tourists spent $2.3 billion on casino games during their visits in 2016. That’s up from $2 billion in 2015.

So it’s clear that there’s demand for casino gaming north of the border, and any expansion of gambling options by the OLG is likely to be welcome news for fans and businesses alike.

#  how toronto blue jays are using analytics to win at smart blackjack

The Toronto Blue Jays have been one of the most successful teams in baseball in recent years, thanks in part to their use of analytics. One area where they have particularly benefited from analytics is blackjack.

Blackjack is a casino game that relies heavily on luck, but there is also a certain amount of skill involved. The Blue Jays have used analytics to figure out the optimal strategy for blackjack and they have been using this strategy to win at the casino.

The Blue Jays first started using analytics for blackjack in 2014. At that time, they hired a team of analysts who specialize in blackjack strategy. These analysts looked at all the different possible strategies for blackjack and determined which one was the best.

The Blue Jays then implemented this strategy at the casino and it has been very successful. In fact, their success with blackjack has helped them become one of the most profitable teams in baseball.

 Analytics has also played a role in other aspects of the Blue Jays’ game. For example, they use analytics to help them decide which players to sign and how much to offer them. They also use analytics to help them determine which players to start and how to position them on the field.

The Blue Jays are not the only team that uses analytics for blackjack, but they are certainly one of the most successful ones. Thanks to their use of analytics, the Blue Jays are currently one of the best teams in baseball and they look poised to make another run at the World Series this year.
