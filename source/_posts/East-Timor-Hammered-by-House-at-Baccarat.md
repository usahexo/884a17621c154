#  East Timor Hammered by House at Baccarat

East Timor was left reeling Wednesday night after a savage house at the baccarat tables cost the nation millions of dollars.

The debacle began when East Timor's Minister for Finance, José Ramos-Horta, placed a $10 million bet on the house and lost. The losses snowballed from there as other high-ranking officials joined in, betting tens of millions of dollars on the house.

In the end, East Timor lost more than $130 million in a matter of hours. This is a major setback for a nation that is still struggling to rebuild after decades of war and violence.

It is not yet known how this will affect the East Timorese economy, but it is clear that this debacle has inflicted massive damage. Ramos-Horta has already resigned in disgrace, and others may follow soon.

This was a devastating loss for East Timor, and it is still unclear how it will recover from this devastating blow.

#  East Timor Loses Again in Baccarat as House Strikes Hard

East Timor hit a hard loss in the baccarat tables this week as the house edge took its toll. The small Southeast Asian country has been struggling in recent years to pay off its mounting government debt.

Baccarat is a high-stakes card game that favors the house, and East Timor seems unable to escape this unfavorable odds. In an effort to generate more revenue, the government has raised taxes and reduced spending on vital social services. This has only resulted in increased discontent among the population.

East Timor is not alone in its financial troubles. Many developing countries around the world are facing similar challenges. However, many of these nations have found ways to grow their economies and improve their standing. East Timor will need to do the same if it wants to improve the lives of its people.

One potential avenue for growth is tourism. East Timor is a beautiful country with much to offer visitors. With some investment in infrastructure and marketing, the country could see a surge in tourism revenue. This would provide much-needed economic relief and help improve the lives of East Timor’s citizens.

#  East Timor Endures Another Loss at Hands of House in Baccarat

East Timor's finance minister, José Pedro de Jesus, resigned after a $US500,000 ($A691,000) loss in a single night at the baccarat table in Las Vegas.

The news comes as a fresh embarrassment to East Timor which is still struggling to rebuild after a devastating 25-year struggle for independence from Indonesia.

"I deeply regret having lost such a large sum of money and I take full responsibility for my actions," Mr de Jesus said in a statement.

"I am tendering my resignation to the prime minister and I hope that my decision will not adversely affect the work of the government."

East Timor's Prime Minister Rui Araùjo said he had accepted the resignation but warned that further losses could jeopardise the country's fragile economy.

"The government cannot accept irresponsible behaviour from its ministers that could risk our public finances," he said.


East Timor is one of Asia's poorest countries and ranks among the most corrupt. The former Portuguese colony declared independence from Indonesia in 2002 following years of bloody fighting.

#  East Timor Falls to House Again in Baccarat Play

The East Timor Casino falls to the house in another baccarat game. Results from the game, played earlier this month, show that the casino lost a total of $8,530 on the night.

This is not the first time that the casino has fallen to the house; it has now lost money on six out of the past seven baccarat games.

One player who was at the table that night said that it was "pretty much a given" that the house would win. "There's never any doubt in my mind," they said.

Despite these losses, East Timor Casino remains popular with players. Many say that it offers some of the best odds in town and is well worth a visit.

#  Baccarat Rules Ring Troubling Bell for East Timor

East Timor is one of the four countries, apart from Cambodia, Laos and Vietnam, where baccarat is regularly played.

The popularity of the game in the country has seen a number of casinos open in recent years, including the Dili Bay Resort and Casino, the largest casino in East Timor.

The game is believed to have been introduced to the country by Portuguese colonialists in the 16th century.

Baccarat is a simple game to play and can be enjoyed by players of all levels of experience. The aim of the game is to bet on whose hand will total closest to nine.

There are three possible outcomes in baccarat - player, banker or tie. If you bet on the player and they win, you will receive even money on your bet plus your stake back. If you bet on the banker and they win, you will receive 1.5 times your stake back. If there is a tie, then you will receive your stake back multiplied by eight.

East Timor has been beset by political problems in recent years and this appears to be having an impact on the gambling industry in the country. In June 2018, Reuters reported that casino operators in East Timor were struggling as a result of increasing taxes and political instability.

The Dili Bay Resort and Casino closed its doors in March 2018 after it was unable to pay its taxes. The casino had been forced to close temporarily twice before due to political unrest.
