#  France Officially Announces Casino Blackjack Unit Counting Ban

In an attempt to curtail the use of advantage play in its casinos, France has announced a ban on players counting cards at blackjack tables. The new measure, which went into effect over the weekend, is intended to make it more difficult for cheaters to win at the game, and is part of a larger crackdown on casino cheating that began last year.

Under the new rules, casino employees are now allowed to ask players how they are keeping track of the cards, and those who refuse to answer or are found to be using forbidden methods can be kicked out of the casino. In addition, players caught counting cards can now be fined up to €5,000 (US$5,700).

Casino officials say they hope the new ban will make advantage play less profitable and ultimately discourage cheaters from targeting French casinos. While some players have expressed concern that the new rules will make it more difficult to win at blackjack, others say they are not overly concerned since card counting is not as effective with multiple decks.

The move by France comes as other countries around the world are also taking steps to combat casino cheating. In October 2017, for example, China announced plans to launch a nationwide crackdown on gambling crimes that include card counting.

#  French Casino Crackdown: No More Unit Counting

The French government is cracking down on casinos, with a new law banning the use of unit counting by players. The law, which came into effect on January 1st, 2019, is designed to stop what the government sees as cheating by players.

Casino operators have welcomed the move, saying that it will level the playing field and ensure that everyone is playing by the same rules. The ban on unit counting follows similar moves in other countries, including the United States and Australia.

Unit counting is a technique used by players to track how many high-value cards remain in the deck, in order to make informed betting decisions. By using this technique, players can bet more heavily when there are fewer high-value cards left in the deck, and vice versa.

Critics of unit counting say that it gives some players an unfair advantage over those who don't use the technique. They argue that casinos should be able to set their own rules and that players should not be able to gain an edge by using advanced techniques.

Supporters of unit counting say that it is a legitimate way to play the game and that it helps level the playing field between novice and experienced players. They also argue that casinos have no right to ban techniques that players use legitimately to improve their chances of winning.

The new French law bans not just unit counting but also any other technique that gives players an edge over casino operators. This includes techniques such as card counting and edge sorting. Casino employees are now allowed to ask anyone suspected of using such techniques to leave the premises.

#  France prohibits casino blackjack unit counting

France has taken a definitive stance against casino blackjack players who use card counting techniques to improve their odds of winning. The new decree, signed into law by Prime Minister Manuel Valls, imposes a €1,500 ($1,700) fine on any player caught counting cards at a French casino.

The new prohibition is the latest measure in a broad crackdown on gambling in France. Last year, the government banned online poker and began confiscating the assets of convicted gamblers. In addition, casino operators have been ordered to install more sophisticated surveillance equipment to detect cheating and money laundering.

The ban on blackjack card counting is likely motivated by concerns that the practice gives players an unfair advantage. Card counters keep track of the high and low cards played, allowing them to make better decisions about when to bet and when to fold. This can increase their chances of winning by as much as 5%.

Opponents of the ban argue that card counting is a legitimate strategy that should be allowed in a free and open society. They also point out that casinos have long used similar techniques to detect cheaters and prevent them from winning.

The new law goes into effect on July 1st, 2016.

#  French Casinos Implement New Measures to Combat Unit Counting

In what is seen as an effort to thwart cheating by professional players, French casinos have started using new measures to combat unit counting. The new system, which went into effect on January 1st, will require players to use a special chip to place their bets.

The chip, which is different in color and size from the regular chips used in the casino, will be automatically tracked by the casino's computer system. This means that any changes in the bet quantity will be recorded, allowing casino personnel to detect any attempts at cheating by counting units.

Casino operators believe that the new system will help them protect their profits and ensure a fair gaming experience for all players. Professional players, however, are already finding ways around the new measures.

One technique being used is to split bets between different colored chips. This makes it more difficult for the casino's computer system to track individual bet quantities, and can make it difficult for casino staff to determine if a player is trying to cheat.

Professional players are also said to be using special software programs that help them count units while playing online casinos games. This allows them to take advantage of bonuses and other promotions offered by online casinos without having to worry about getting caught cheating.

Despite these efforts, casino operators remain confident that the new measures will help them reduce cheating by professional players.

#  Unions Threaten Strike as France toughens stance on casino blackjack unit counting

Unions representing some 2,000 casino workers in France are threatening to go on strike after the government toughened its stance on blackjack card counting.

The new measures would see dealers forced to keep track of each card played, making it more difficult for players to count them and gain an advantage over the house.

In a statement, the Unsa and CGT unions said they "strongly condemn the government's decision which will only lead to more unemployment in a sector that is already in difficulty".

The unions argue that the new measures will make it harder for casinos to compete with neighbouring countries such as Belgium and Switzerland, where counting cards is not currently illegal.

"This decision...will penalise our casinos at a time when they are already struggling against competition from abroad," they said.

"We call on the government to withdraw this project and we reserve the right to go on strike."
