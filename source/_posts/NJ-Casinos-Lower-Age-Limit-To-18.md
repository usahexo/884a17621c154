#  NJ Casinos Lower Age Limit To 18

In order to better compete against Pennsylvania casinos, NJ casinos are lowering their age limit to 18.

This move is expected to help NJ casinos recapture some of the gambling dollars that have gone to PA casinos in recent years. New Jersey casinos currently have an age limit of 21.

The Borgata, Caesars, Harrah's, and Ocean Resort all announced they will lower their age limit to 18 starting on July 1st. MGM and Golden Nugget have not yet announced whether they will follow suit.

According to analysts, this change is necessary because PA has been stealing market share from NJ casinos due to its lower age limit of 21. PA also offers a wider variety of gambling options than NJ.

NJ's lowered age limit is also a response to last year's Supreme Court decision which allowed states to legalize sports betting. That decision opened up the door for NJ casinos to offer more gambling options beyond just slots and table games.

#  NJ Casino OKs Slot Machines For Those 18 And Older

The New Jersey Casino Control Commission has approved a proposal to allow slot machines for those 18 and older in the state.

Under the new rule, casinos will be able to offer so-called “teen slots” where those 18 to 21 can gamble on certain machines. The commission said the move is being made to allow for more competition in the casino industry and also create jobs.

Commission chairman James Plousis said the change will also help keep casino tourism spending in the state.

“Allowing these young adults access to the teen slots will create a more level playing field, stimulate economic development and result in job growth at our casinos,” he said in a statement.

Supporters of the change say it will make gambling more age-appropriate and avoid exposing minors to casinos. Opponents say it could lead to gambling addictions at an early age.

#  Minimum Age To Gamble In NJ Casinos Slashed To 18

The minimum age to gamble in NJ casinos was slashed to 18 yesterday, following the passage of a bill by the state legislature. The move is seen as an effort to keep casino revenue in the state, as young people are known to be heavy gamblers.

The minimum age had been set at 21 since casinos began operating in Atlantic City in 1978. But with gambling now legal in neighbouring states, the NJ legislature decided that a lower minimum age was necessary to keep revenue from leaving the state.

"The idea is that if people can gamble legally at 18, they might as well do it here in New Jersey," said Assemblyman John Burzichelli, one of the sponsors of the bill. "This could be a major shot in the arm for our casinos and racetracks."

The decision has been met with mixed reactions. Some people see it as a cynical ploy by the government to make more money off of its citizens, while others see it as a sign that gambling is becoming increasingly mainstream.

"It's just another way for the government to make money off of its citizens," said one resident of Newark. "They're going to suck us dry."

Others welcomed the change. "I think it's great," said one woman from Hoboken. "It makes gambling more accessible, and that can only be good for business."

#  NJ Casinos Approve Use Of Slot Machines By 18 Year Olds

Atlantic City casinos have approved the use of slot machines by 18 year olds, making New Jersey the first state to do so.

According to the Associated Press, a spokesman for Gov. Chris Christie confirmed that the state’s gaming regulators had given their approval for 18 year olds to gamble on slot machines in Atlantic City casinos.

The decision came after Christie signed a bill into law in January that lowered the legal gambling age from 21 to 18. The measure was designed to help revive Atlantic City’s struggling gaming industry.
