#  Mayweather-McGregor bout may break betting record

The much-anticipated boxing match between undefeated champion Floyd Mayweather Jr. and UFC champion Conor McGregor is expected to break the betting record, according to ESPN.

A sports book in Las Vegas has taken six times the amount of money bet on Mayweather as it has on McGregor, with 85% of bets placed on the undefeated champion.

"It's not even close," said Kevin Bradley, sports analyst for Bovada told ESPN. "Vegas thinks that Floyd Mayweather is going to slaughter Conor McGregor."

The previous betting record was set in 2013 when Mayweather fought Saul "Canelo" Alvarez. That fight generated $20 million in bets with Mayweather as a 9-5 favorite.

Mayweather is currently a -550 favorite (bet $550 to win $100), while McGregor is a +325 underdog (bet $100 to win $325).

#  In sports betting, $100 million bet on Mayweather fight

The upcoming fight between Floyd Mayweather Jr. and Conor McGregor is one of the most highly anticipated in recent memory. The event is expected to break all sorts of records, with Sports Illustrated estimating that as much as $100 million could be bet on the fight.

This would easily eclipse the previous record for largest bet on a boxing match, which was set in 2013 when $30 million was wagered on Mayweather’s victory over Saul Alvarez. If accurate, it would also make the Mayweather-McGregor bout the second-biggest sporting event in terms of total betting volume, trailing only last year’s Super Bowl.

While individual bets will no doubt range in size, it’s thought that the average wager on this fight will be around $1,000. That means that if you want to have a chance at winning big, you need to put down some serious cash.

If you’re thinking about betting on Mayweather-McGregor, there are a few things you need to know first. First and foremost, understand the difference between moneyline odds and point spread odds. Moneyline odds reflect who is favored to win the fight, while point spread odds reflect how many rounds the fight is expected to last.

Mayweather is currently a heavy favorite at -700 (meaning you would need to risk $700 to win $100), while McGregor is +500 (meaning you would win $500 for every $100 bet). The point spread for this fight has not been released yet, but it’s likely that it will be quite large given Mayweather’s dominance in the ring.

Another thing you need to consider before placing your bet is how likely you think each fighter is to win. Mayweather has never lost a professional boxing match and is considered by many experts to be one of the best pound-for-pound fighters of all time. McGregor, on the other hand, has no professional boxing experience and is considered a huge underdog in this matchup.

All things considered, if you think Mayweather is going to win easily then moneyline odds are your best bet. If you think McGregor has at least a small chance of pulling off an upset, then go with the point spread instead. No matter which fighter you choose,[카지노 사이트](https://choegocasino.com/) always make sure you research his or her past performances extensively before placing your bet.

#  Singapore Pools Expects to Take In S$13 Million in Sports Betting This Week 

Singapore Pools is expecting to take in S$13 million in sports betting this week, which is up from the S$10 million it took in last week. This is due to the World Cup, which has been attracting a lot of interest from bettors.

"This is likely to be one of our busiest weeks ever," said Seah Keng Huat, the business development manager at Singapore Pools. "There's a lot of excitement around the World Cup, and that's translating into a lot of bets being placed."

In addition to sports betting, Singapore Pools also offers lottery and Toto games. It has seen a surge in popularity for these games as well, with sales for both doubling this week compared to last week.

"It's been great to see so much interest in our games," said Seah. "We're looking forward to seeing even more people come out and try their luck."

#  Australian bookmakers take in more than $1 million on Wallabies-Lions

The Australian bookmakers have taken in more than $1 million on the Wallabies-Lions Test series. The three-Test series kicked off on Saturday at Brisbane’s Suncorp Stadium, with the Australians winning 23-21 against the touring British and Irish Lions.

Australian bookmaker Tabcorp alone has taken in more than $500,000 on the Test series, a spokesman said. Ladbrokes spokesman Robert Hadler said his company had also taken a “significant six-figure sum” on the series, which was evenly split between the two teams.

Most of the betting has been placed on the result of each match, rather than which team will win the series, Mr Hadler said. punters had “loved” betting on underdog Wallabies to upset odds-on favourites Lions, he added.

“There is plenty of interest in 4-11 and 6-5 (odds) about Wallabies winning theTest matches respectively, while there is only limited interest in backing British and Irish Lions to whitewash Australia 3-0 at 1-10 odds.”

Brett Mullins, a former Australian rugby union international who played fullback against the Lions in their 1991 tour Down Under, expects an exciting Test series. But he told Fairfax Media that home ground advantage would be key for the Wallabies.

“Australia are definitely up against it – they haven’t had a lot of success in Lions tours – but I think they will win one of the Tests and probably the last one as well,” Mullins said.

The second Test will take place at Melbourne’s Etihad Stadium this Saturday before concluding at Sydney’s Allianz Stadium next week Saturday July 7th.
