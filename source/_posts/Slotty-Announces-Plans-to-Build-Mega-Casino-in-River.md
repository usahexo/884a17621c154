#  River Stone Casino Moving Forward with Construction

Just a few months ago, River Stone Casino hit a snag in their plans to break ground on their new property. A legal challenge from an adjacent landowner threatened to hold up the entire project. However, after months of negotiations, both sides have come to an agreement that will allow construction to begin as planned.

According to representatives for the casino, the new property will be a major boon for the local economy. It is expected to create hundreds of jobs and bring millions of dollars in revenue to the area. In addition, the casino will be home to a world-class resort and spa, which is sure to attract tourists from all over.

Construction is already underway and is expected to be completed by late 2019. So far, things are going according to schedule and it looks like the casino will be able to open its doors on time.

This is great news for the people of River Stone and everyone who has been looking forward to this project. With a world-class casino and resort coming to town, thereâ€™s no telling what kind of positive impact it will have on the community as a whole.

#  Workers Break Ground on River Stone Casino

The long-awaited River Stone Casino is now one step closer to becoming a reality after a ceremonial ground breaking took place Wednesday morning.

Nearly 100 workers were on hand for the event, marking the beginning of construction on the $450 million project.

"This is a very significant day for the citizens of Nemaha County and the surrounding area," said casino developer Randy Crosby. "We are excited to get started on this project and create hundreds of jobs and bring new economic development to the region."

The casino will include a 131,000-square-foot gaming floor with more than 1,000 slot machines and 32 table games. It will also feature a hotel, restaurant and concert venue.

Construction is expected to be completed by early 2020.

#  First Phase of River Stone Casino Construction Complete

The first phase of the River Stone Casino construction project is now complete. This $360 million development is the largest private investment in the history of the state of Oklahoma. The new casino will be open for business in just a few months.

The first phase of the project includes a 300-room hotel, a 50,000-square-foot gaming floor, and several restaurants and lounges. The project has already created 1,000 jobs, and it is expected to create an additional 2,000 jobs once it is open for business.

"This is a historic day for our company," said John Hammond, CEO of River Stone Casino. "We are proud to be investing in the state of Oklahoma and creating thousands of jobs in the process."

The new casino will offer a variety of gaming options, including slots, table games, and poker. It will also have a luxurious spa and fitness center.

The opening of River Stone Casino is expected to generate more than $100 million in annual revenue for the state of Oklahoma.
