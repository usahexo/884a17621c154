        <h1 id="Lawmakers-Vote-in-Favor-of-Sports-Betting-Bill-Headed-to-Governor"><a href="#Lawmakers-Vote-in-Favor-of-Sports-Betting-Bill-Headed-to-Governor" class="headerlink" title="Lawmakers Vote in Favor of Sports Betting; Bill Headed to Governor"></a>Lawmakers Vote in Favor of Sports Betting; Bill Headed to Governor</h1><p>In a vote held on Monday, lawmakers in the state of New Jersey voted in favor of a bill that would legalize sports betting in the state. The measure now goes to Governor Phil Murphy, who is expected to sign it into law.</p>
<p>The move would make New Jersey the second state in the nation to allow sports betting, after Nevada. It would also give a major boost to the state’s casino industry, which has been struggling in recent years.</p>
<p>“This is something that I’ve been committed to since I started running for office,” said Assemblyman Ralph Caputo, a Democrat from Essex County and one of the sponsors of the bill.</p>
<p>Under the proposed law, casinos and racetracks would be able to offer sports betting, subject to approval from the New Jersey Casino Control Commission and the New Jersey Racing Commission. Monmouth Park Racetrack has already announced plans to offer sports betting as soon as Murphy signs the bill into law.</p>
<p>The vote was largely along party lines, with Republicans opposing the measure and Democrats supporting it. Some lawmakers expressed concern that legalized sports betting could lead to an increase in gambling addiction rates, but others argued that it would generate much-needed revenue for the state.</p>
<p> Murphy has said he supports legalizing sports betting and is expected to sign the bill into law.</p>
<h1 id="NJ-Assembly-Passes-Sports-Betting-Bill"><a href="#NJ-Assembly-Passes-Sports-Betting-Bill" class="headerlink" title="NJ Assembly Passes Sports Betting Bill"></a>NJ Assembly Passes Sports Betting Bill</h1><p>On Monday, the NJ Assembly green-lighted a bill that would legalize sports betting in the state. The proposed legislation would allow casinos and racetracks to offer sports betting, pending approval from the state’s gaming commission.</p>
<p>“This is a monumental day for the state of New Jersey and its economy,” said Assemblyman Ralph Caputo. “Not only will this measure create jobs and pump money into our casinos and racetracks, but it will also bring in much-needed revenue for our pension system.”</p>
<p>NJ is one of several states currently vying for legalization of sports betting, following last month’s Supreme Court ruling that struck down a federal ban on the practice. Delaware was the first state to take advantage of the ruling, launching full-fledged sports betting within minutes of the decision.</p>
<p>The passage of NJ’s bill comes just days after Gov. Phil Murphy laid out his plans for legalizing cannabis in the state. Murphy has made it a priority to legalize both sports betting and cannabis in his first year in office, citing the potential for millions of dollars in new tax revenue.</p>
<p>“It’s great to see that we’re moving ahead on both fronts,” said Murphy spokesperson Alyana Alfaro. “These measures will generate hundreds of millions of dollars in new revenue, create jobs, and improve public health.”</p>
<h1 id="Legislature-OKs-Sports-Betting-Bill-Heads-to-Christie"><a href="#Legislature-OKs-Sports-Betting-Bill-Heads-to-Christie" class="headerlink" title="Legislature OKs Sports Betting; Bill Heads to Christie"></a>Legislature OKs Sports Betting; Bill Heads to Christie</h1><p>The New Jersey state legislature on Monday approved a bill to allow sports betting in casinos and racetracks, sending the measure to Governor Chris Christie, a Republican who has said he will sign it.</p>
<p>If Christie signs the bill, New Jersey would become the second state after Delaware to allow regulated sports betting within its borders.</p>
<p>The move comes as states face growing pressure to bring in new revenue sources to help address budget deficits. New Jersey’s Assembly voted 77-5 in favor of the bill, while the Senate passed it by a vote of 24-16.</p>
<p>“This is something that’s been talked about for years and I’m glad we’re finally able to get it done,” said Assemblyman Ralph Caputo, a Democrat from Essex County. “It’s an important step in economic development.”</p>
<p>Proponents of legalized sports betting say it could generate millions of dollars in tax revenue for the state. They also argue that it would create jobs and boost tourism.</p>
<p>Opponents contend that the social costs of gambling addiction could outweigh any benefits.</p>
<h1 id="NJ-Assembly-Just-Says-No-to-Sports-Gambling"><a href="#NJ-Assembly-Just-Says-No-to-Sports-Gambling" class="headerlink" title="NJ Assembly Just Says No to Sports Gambling"></a>NJ Assembly Just Says No to Sports Gambling</h1><p>In a vote of 75-5, the New Jersey state Assembly declined to pass a bill that would have legalized sports gambling in the state. The proposed legislation would have allowed Atlantic City casinos and racetracks to take bets on professional and college sports, but it appears that lawmakers decided that the potential revenue from such gaming was not worth the possible social costs.</p>
<p>Supporters of the measure argued that legalizing sports betting would help shore up Atlantic City’s casino industry, which has been struggling in recent years. But opponents countered that the social ills associated with gambling - including addiction and financial ruin - outweighed any potential benefits.</p>
<p>State Assembly Speaker Vincent Prieto said after the vote that he did not believe there was enough support in the legislature to pass the bill. “I think it’s dead for this session,” he said.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, supporters of legalizing sports betting say they will continue to fight for the measure. John Palmieri, executive director of the Casino Association of New Jersey, called the vote “disappointing” and vowed to “continue to work with policymakers to create a sports betting framework.”</p>
<p>The outcome of the vote in New Jersey is just the latest development in the nationwide debate over legalizing sports gambling. In May, the US Supreme Court struck down a federal law that had prohibited most states from allowing such gaming. Since then, several states have moved to legalize it, while others are still considering how best to proceed.</p>
<h1 id="NJ-Legislators-Fail-to-Pass-Sports-Betting"><a href="#NJ-Legislators-Fail-to-Pass-Sports-Betting" class="headerlink" title="NJ Legislators Fail to Pass Sports Betting"></a>NJ Legislators Fail to Pass Sports Betting</h1><p>Assembly Speaker Vincent Prieto said that the vote in the lower house on Thursday to approve a measure permitting sports betting in New Jersey was “close”, but apparently not close enough as the bill failed to pass.</p>
<p>The vote was 48-27, with two abstentions, falling one vote short of passage in the Assembly. The bill needed 48 votes for passage because it is a constitutional amendment.</p>
<p>“We’re disappointed,” said Len DeLuca, executive vice president of the Gloucester County Chamber of Commerce, which supported the legislation. “It’s something that would’ve helped stimulate business and help with tax revenue.”</p>
<p>Governor Chris Christie has been a big proponent of legalizing sports gambling in New Jersey, seeing it as a way to help revive the state’s economy, which has been struggling in recent years. He is expected to veto the measure if it doesn’t pass both houses by Friday, which looks increasingly likely at this point.</p>
<p>The Assembly bill would have allowed Atlantic City casinos and racetracks to offer sports betting, with the Monmouth Park Racetrack in Oceanport being first in line.</p>
