        <h1 id="What-is-21-blackjack"><a href="#What-is-21-blackjack" class="headerlink" title="What is 21 blackjack?"></a>What is 21 blackjack?</h1><p>21 blackjack is a popular casino game that is played with two decks of cards. The goal of the game is to beat the dealer’s hand by either getting 21 points on your first two cards, or by taking as many cards as necessary to reach 21 points total.</p>
<h1 id="How-to-play"><a href="#How-to-play" class="headerlink" title="How to play"></a>How to play</h1><p>To begin the game, the player places their bet in the betting circle. They are then given two cards face up. The dealer is also given two cards, but one is face down. The player then decides whether they would like to take another card (hit) or stand. If they hit and get a value of 11 or more, they must stand regardless of what the dealer has. If their total equals 21 (blackjack), they automatically win and receive double their bet amount. If their total is less than 21, the dealer takes another card and compares their total against the players. Wins are paid out at even money, meaning that if you bet $10 and won, you would get back $20 including your initial stake.</p>
<p>There are a number of other rules that apply depending on the specific variant being played, but these are the basics of how to play 21 blackjack.</p>
<h1 id="Where-is-Tennessee"><a href="#Where-is-Tennessee" class="headerlink" title="Where is Tennessee?"></a>Where is Tennessee?</h1><p>Tennessee is located in the southeastern United States. It is bordered by Kentucky and Virginia to the north, North Carolina to the east, Georgia to the south, and Alabama to the west. The state capital is Nashville and the largest city is Memphis.</p>
<p>Tennessee was part of the territory ceded by Great Britain to the United States in 1783 as part of the Treaty of Paris following the American Revolutionary War. In 1790, it became the 16th state to enter the Union. Tennessee was a major front in the American Civil War, with more than 80,000 Tennesseans serving in the Union army.</p>
<p>Today, Tennessee is a mix of mountains and rolling hills in the east, transitioning to wide river valleys and cotton fields in the west. The state has a rich musical heritage and is known for its country music scene. Tourism plays a significant role in Tennessee’s economy, with attractions including Elvis Presley’s Graceland estate, Dollywood theme park, and Beale Street in Memphis.</p>
<h1 id="Who-was-George-Walker-Bush"><a href="#Who-was-George-Walker-Bush" class="headerlink" title="Who was George Walker Bush?"></a>Who was George Walker Bush?</h1><p>George Walker Bush was born on July 6, 1946, in New Haven, Connecticut. He was the eldest son of George Herbert Walker Bush and Barbara Pierce. After graduating from Phillips Academy in Andover, Massachusetts, in 1964, he attended Yale University, where he was a member of the Delta Kappa Epsilon fraternity. He married Laura Welch in 1977 and became a father of twin girls, Jenna and Barbara.</p>
<p>Bush began his career in the energy business, working for an oil company in Venezuela. He later served as campaign manager for his father’s successful run for president in 1988. In 1994, Bush was elected governor of Texas. During his tenure as governor, he oversaw several tax and education reforms, and also presided over the state’s recovery from Hurricane Katrina.</p>
<p>In 2000, Bush ran for president of the United States and won election against Democratic nominee Al Gore after a contentious recount process in Florida. As president, he enacted major legislation including the No Child Left Behind Act and made cuts to income taxes. He also authorized the invasion of Iraq in 2003 despite opposition from many countries around the world.</p>
<p>Bush left office in 2009 with low approval ratings due to the ongoing Iraq War and the global recession. Since leaving office, he has remained relatively quiet but has voiced support for conservative causes such as immigration reform and gun rights.</p>
<h1 id="What-were-some-of-George-W-Bush’s-key-policies"><a href="#What-were-some-of-George-W-Bush’s-key-policies" class="headerlink" title="What were some of George W. Bush’s key policies?"></a>What were some of George W. Bush’s key policies?</h1><p>Some of George W. Bush’s key policies included:  </p>
<ul>
<li>The No Child Left Behind Act: This policy established nationwide standards for public schools and required students to pass standardized tests in order to graduate high school. </li>
<li>The invasion of Iraq: This policy authorized military action against Iraq based on accusations that they possessed weapons of mass destruction. </li>
<li>Tax cuts: This policy reduced taxes on income, dividends, and capital gains</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="What-did-he-do"><a href="#What-did-he-do" class="headerlink" title="What did he do?"></a>What did he do?</h1><p>In 2002, when John Allen Muhammad was arrested for being the mastermind of the Beltway sniper attacks that left 10 people dead, many were shocked. This was not the shy, introverted individual that they had been led to believe was responsible for the shootings. In fact, during his trial, Muhammad acted as his own attorney and made a point of displaying his anger and hostility to the court. So what could have driven this man to commit such heinous crimes?</p>
<h1 id="The-Early-Years"><a href="#The-Early-Years" class="headerlink" title="The Early Years"></a>The Early Years</h1><p>Muhammad was born in Baton Rouge, Louisiana in 1960. When he was just 6 years old, his parents divorced and he went to live with his mother and stepfather in Tacoma, Washington. It was here that Muhammad began to exhibit signs of mental illness. He would often become extremely angry and violent for no reason and his teachers described him as “odd” and “withdrawn”. In 1978, he joined the US Army but was discharged just 2 years later after being diagnosed with a personality disorder.</p>
<h1 id="Life-on-the-Run"><a href="#Life-on-the-Run" class="headerlink" title="Life on the Run"></a>Life on the Run</h1><p>After leaving the army, Muhammad began a life on the run. He would move from state to state, often living on the streets or in homeless shelters. In 2001, he met Lee Boyd Malvo – a 17 year old who had also been abandoned by his parents. Muhammad took Malvo under his wing and began training him for the sniper attacks.</p>
<h1 id="The-Attacks"><a href="#The-Attacks" class="headerlink" title="The Attacks"></a>The Attacks</h1><p>The attacks began on October 2nd 2002, when shots were fired at a bus stop in Montgomery County, Maryland. Over the next three weeks, 10 people were killed and 3 others were injured in shootings across Washington D.C., Maryland and Virginia. The attacks finally came to an end on October 24th when both Muhammad and Malvo were arrested at a truck stop in Frederick County, Maryland.</p>
<h1 id="Why-is-he-important"><a href="#Why-is-he-important" class="headerlink" title="Why is he important?"></a>Why is he important?</h1><p>Albert Einstein is considered one of the most important scientists in history. He developed the theory of relativity and helped to usher in the age of quantum mechanics. His work on electromagnetism, photosynthesis and general theory of relativity are still studied and used today. Einstein’s theories were so groundbreaking that they often challenged the conventional wisdom of his time.</p>
<h1 id="The-Theory-of-Relativity"><a href="#The-Theory-of-Relativity" class="headerlink" title="The Theory of Relativity"></a>The Theory of Relativity</h1><p>The theory of relativity is arguably Einstein’s most famous work. It explains how gravity affects motion and how space and time are related. The theory has been tested and confirmed many times and is still used to explain the movement of objects in space.</p>
<h1 id="Quantum-Mechanics"><a href="#Quantum-Mechanics" class="headerlink" title="Quantum Mechanics"></a>Quantum Mechanics</h1><p>Quantum mechanics is the branch of physics that studies the behavior of matter and energy at the atomic and subatomic levels. Einstein helped develop this field with his work on the photoelectric effect. His contributions to quantum mechanics have helped scientists better understand the behavior of particles on a small scale.</p>
