In this article, we will examine the current landscape of online poker in Connecticut and look at what factors might influence the legality of the game in the state.</p>
<h1 id="The-Current-Landscape-of-Online-Poker-in-Connecticut"><a href="#The-Current-Landscape-of-Online-Poker-in-Connecticut" class="headerlink" title="The Current Landscape of Online Poker in Connecticut"></a>The Current Landscape of Online Poker in Connecticut</h1><p>At the moment, online poker is not legal in Connecticut. There are no regulated online poker sites operating in the state and it is illegal for residents to play at offshore sites. However, there does not seem to be any concerted effort on the part of the government to crack down on players who participate in unregulated games.</p>
<h1 id="The-Factors-That-Might-Influence-the-Legality-of-Online-Poker-in-CT"><a href="#The-Factors-That-Might-Influence-the-Legality-of-Online-Poker-in-CT" class="headerlink" title="The Factors That Might Influence the Legality of Online Poker in CT"></a>The Factors That Might Influence the Legality of Online Poker in CT</h1><p>There are several factors that could influence the legality of online poker in Connecticut. These include:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>The opinions of lawmakers – It is likely that the opinion of lawmakers would be a key factor in determining whether or not online poker is made legal in CT. If there is broad support for regulated online poker among legislators, then it is likely that the game would be legalized relatively quickly. However, if there is strong opposition to online poker, then it could take longer for legislation to be passed.</p>
</li>
<li><p>The stance of the government – Another important factor that would influence the legality of online poker is the stance of the government. If regulators take a negative view towards online gaming, then it is likely that they will not legalize sites like PokerStars and partypoker. However, if they are open to properly regulating and licensing such sites, then it is more likely that legislation will be passed relatively quickly.</p>
</li>
<li><p>The potential benefits for the state – Finally, one of the main factors that legislators will consider when deciding whether or not to legalize online poker is the potential benefits for the state. If regulators feel that legalizing online gaming could bring significant revenue into state coffers, then they may be more willing to pass legislation. However, if they believe that there are few benefits to be gained from legalized gaming, then they may choose not to act on it.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h1 id="Judge-Orders-Online-Gaming-be-Made-Legal-in-CT"><a href="#Judge-Orders-Online-Gaming-be-Made-Legal-in-CT" class="headerlink" title="Judge Orders Online Gaming be Made Legal in CT"></a>Judge Orders Online Gaming be Made Legal in CT</h1><p>In a unanimous vote, the CT House of Representatives voted this week in favor of legalizing online gaming in the state. The bill, HB 7143, now moves to the Senate for debate and a vote.</p>
<p>The legislation would allow eligible Connecticut residents age 21 or older to play casino-style games such as poker, blackjack and slots on their computers or mobile devices. The state would regulate and tax the industry, with proceeds going to the Department of Consumer Protection and the Department of Mental Health and Addiction Services.</p>
<p>Rep. Antonio Guerrera, D-Rocky Hill, who is co-chairman of the Public Safety Committee, said “This is about creating jobs, bringing in new revenue for the state and giving people an opportunity to do something they love from the comfort of their homes.”</p>
<p>Opponents of online gaming say it can lead to addiction and other problems, but supporters point to studies that show it can be safely regulated.</p>
<p>The bill must still pass the Senate before it goes to Gov. Dannel P. Malloy for his signature, but that is seen as a formality given Malloy’s previous support for expanded gambling in Connecticut.</p>
<p>This bill comes as good news for many CT residents who enjoy playing casino games online. Proponents say that it will create jobs and bring in new revenue for the state, while opponents worry about potential addiction problems.</p>
<h1 id="Connecticut-Online-Poker-Legislation-Passes"><a href="#Connecticut-Online-Poker-Legislation-Passes" class="headerlink" title="Connecticut Online Poker Legislation Passes!"></a>Connecticut Online Poker Legislation Passes!</h1><p>On Wednesday, October 5th, 2016, the Connecticut House of Representatives voted in favor of HB 7073, a bill that would legalize and regulate online poker within the state.</p>
<p>The vote was overwhelmingly in favor, with a final tally of 119-28. The bill will now move on to the Senate for further consideration.</p>
<p>This is great news for Connecticut poker players, as it would finally give them a safe and legal way to play online poker. It would also generate much-needed revenue for the state government, as online poker would be taxed at a rate of 15%.</p>
<p>Under HB 7073, the Connecticut Department of Consumer Protection would be responsible for regulating online poker. This would include setting up the necessary rules and procedures for running safe and fair games.</p>
<p>Players would also be protected under this legislation, as they would be guaranteed the same consumer protection rights that are currently offered to those playing in live casinos. This includes protections against cheating, identity theft, and financial fraud.</p>
<p>One thing that is still unclear is how the bill will deal with players who are currently playing on unregulated sites. It is possible that these players may be forced to leave these sites and switch to regulated ones, or that they may be given a grace period to make the switch.</p>
<p>We should know more about this once the Senate takes up the bill for consideration.</p>
<h1 id="Connecticut-Becomes-17th-State-to-Legalize-Online-Poker"><a href="#Connecticut-Becomes-17th-State-to-Legalize-Online-Poker" class="headerlink" title="Connecticut Becomes 17th State to Legalize Online Poker"></a>Connecticut Becomes 17th State to Legalize Online Poker</h1><p>On Wednesday, June 5, the Connecticut House of Representatives passed a bill to legalize online poker within the state. The vote was 79-62, with all Republicans and six Democrats voting against the measure. The bill will now head to the desk of Governor Ned Lamont for his signature.</p>
<p>The bill, HB 7077, would allow for both intrastate and interstate play, subject to regulations established by the Connecticut Gaming Commission. Licensees would be required to pay an annual fee of $10,000, and would be prohibited from offering sports betting or other forms of gambling.</p>
<p>The legislation has been championed by Rep. Joe Verrengia (D-West Hartford), who introduced a similar bill in 2017 that failed to gain traction. “I’ve been working on this for two years,” said Verrengia in a statement after Wednesday’s vote. “It’s good policy, it’s good for the state, it’s good for jobs, and I’m glad the House passed it.”</p>
<p>Opponents of the bill argue that it will create an unregulated gambling market and increase addiction rates in the state. Rep. Rosa Rebimbas (R-Naugatuck) expressed concerns that the legislation did not include enough protections for consumers or restrictions on predatory practices by offshore operators. “This is not a regulated industry,” she said in debate on the floor of the House. “We are just putting a Band-Aid on a hemorrhage.”</p>
<p>Governor Lamont has not indicated whether he intends to sign the bill into law.</p>
<h1 id="Connecticut-Joins-Growing-List-of-States-to-Legalize-Online-Gambling"><a href="#Connecticut-Joins-Growing-List-of-States-to-Legalize-Online-Gambling" class="headerlink" title="Connecticut Joins Growing List of States to Legalize Online Gambling"></a>Connecticut Joins Growing List of States to Legalize Online Gambling</h1><p>Connecticut has become the latest state to legalize online gambling, following in the footsteps of New Jersey, Nevada and Delaware. The new law allows residents of Connecticut to place bets on sporting events, play casino games and gamble on horse races online.</p>
<p>Supporters of the bill argue that it will help generate much-needed revenue for the state government, while opponents claim that it will lead to increased rates of problem gambling. Regardless of which side you believe, it is clear that online gambling is here to stay and is only going to become more popular in the years ahead.</p>
<p>So far, the results of legalized online gambling have been mixed. In New Jersey, for example, online gambling has generated over $200 million in tax revenue since it was legalized in 2013. However, at the same time there have been reports of increased rates of problem gambling among users.</p>
<p>The same trend has been seen in other states that have legalized online gambling. While there are certainly benefits to be gained from legalizing this activity, there are also some risks that need to be considered.</p>
<p>Overall, I think it is fair to say that the pros outweigh the cons when it comes to legalizing online gambling. With more and more states moving towards legalization, it is likely that this trend will continue in the years ahead.</p>
