Bush Goes All In on Green Shell in Roulette"></a>George W. Bush Goes All In on Green Shell in Roulette</h1><p>Casinos around the world have been using green shells in roulette games for years, but no one has ever used as many as George W. Bush. The former President of the United States is known for his love of gambling and he recently put his money where his mouth is by going all in on a single green shell at the Mirage casino in Las Vegas.</p>
<p>Bush, who was visiting Las Vegas with his wife Laura, made the bold move on Saturday night and it quickly paid off. The green shell ended up landing on number 22, giving Bush a payout of $27,500. “I’m not a big risk taker, but I felt pretty good about this bet,” Bush said after winning the jackpot. “I’ve been playing roulette for a while and I know that green shells are hot.”</p>
<p>Bush isn’t the only high-profile gambler to hit it big at the Mirage casino recently. Last month, Floyd Mayweather Jr. walked away with a $1.5 million payday after hitting a blackjack hand worth 21 points.</p>
<h1 id="George-Walker-Bush-Wins-Big-With-Green-Shell-Bet-on-Roulette"><a href="#George-Walker-Bush-Wins-Big-With-Green-Shell-Bet-on-Roulette" class="headerlink" title="George Walker Bush Wins Big With Green Shell Bet on Roulette"></a>George Walker Bush Wins Big With Green Shell Bet on Roulette</h1><p>George Walker Bush was in top form at the casino on Saturday night, winning big with a green shell bet on roulette.</p>
<p>The former president started the night by winning $1,000 with a black number bet. He followed that up with a $2,000 win on a red number.</p>
<p>Bush then placed his biggest bet of the night, wagering $10,000 on a green number. The wheel spun and came to rest on 22, giving Bush a massive win!</p>
<p>“I’m feeling pretty lucky tonight,” Bush said after cashing in his chips. “I may go all in on black next.”</p>
<p>Bush’s impressive win streak comes at a time when he’s been facing some criticism for his recent comments about the current state of the Republican Party.</p>
<p>Many pundits are saying that Bush’s comments are proof that he’s out of touch with the modern GOP. But Bush doesn’t seem too worried.</p>
<p>“I’m not going to change my views just because I’m no longer in office,” Bush said in an interview earlier this week. “I think the Republican Party needs to get back to its conservative roots.”</p>
<h1 id="George-W-Bush-Loses-Big-With-Green-Shell-Bet-on-Roulette"><a href="#George-W-Bush-Loses-Big-With-Green-Shell-Bet-on-Roulette" class="headerlink" title="George W. Bush Loses Big With Green Shell Bet on Roulette"></a>George W. Bush Loses Big With Green Shell Bet on Roulette</h1><p>George W. Bush was in the blackjack pits at the Wynn Resort in Las Vegas last night, and he was feeling lucky. He had just won a few hands in a row and decided to up the stakes, much to the chagrin of his Secret Service detail.</p>
<p>“I’ve been playing online poker for years, so I know what I’m doing,” said Bush.</p>
<p>The former President decided to bet $100 on blackjack that he could also guess the next spin of the roulette wheel would be green. He lost spectacularly, and as word spread throughout the casino of the former President’s bad beat, Bush was quickly surrounded by autograph seekers.</p>
<p>Bush didn’t seem too fazed by the incident, quipping “At least I didn’t lose as much money as I did when I invaded Iraq.”</p>
<h1 id="George-Walker-Bush-The-Luckiest-Man-Alive-or-Dumbest-Gambler"><a href="#George-Walker-Bush-The-Luckiest-Man-Alive-or-Dumbest-Gambler" class="headerlink" title="George Walker Bush - The Luckiest Man Alive or Dumbest Gambler?"></a>George Walker Bush - The Luckiest Man Alive or Dumbest Gambler?</h1><p>What if we told you that the 43rd President of the United States was the luckiest man alive? Or alternatively, the dumbest gambler to ever hold office? You’d probably think we were crazy, but bear with us.</p>
<p>It’s all to do with a little-known piece of legislation that George W. Bush signed into law in September 2008, just two months before he left office. The bill, known as The Emergency Economic Stabilization Act, authorized a $700 billion bailout of the banking system.</p>
<p>Critics argued at the time that the bailout was nothing more than a handout to Wall Street fat cats, and they may have had a point. But what they didn’t know was that George W. Bush was actually betting on the bailout succeeding. And it paid off big time!</p>
<p>How so? Well, by October of 2008 – just one month after the bailout was approved – the stock market had already started to rebound. The Dow Jones Industrial Average reached its lowest point in October 2008 and has since shot up by more than 73%. That means that anyone who invested in stocks in October 2008 would have seen their investment grow by more than three-quarters!</p>
<p>And who benefited from this stock market surge? You guessed it: George W. Bush and his friends on Wall Street. In fact, according to one estimate, Bush made as much as $15 million from his bet on the bailout!</p>
<p>So was George W. Bush simply lucky or did he have some inside information that no one else knew about? We may never know for sure, but one thing is for sure: he was one very lucky gambler!</p>
<h1 id="George-W-Bush-A-Sure-Thing-When-Betting-on-the-Green-Shell-in-Roulette"><a href="#George-W-Bush-A-Sure-Thing-When-Betting-on-the-Green-Shell-in-Roulette" class="headerlink" title="George W. Bush - A Sure Thing When Betting on the Green Shell in Roulette"></a>George W. Bush - A Sure Thing When Betting on the Green Shell in Roulette</h1><p>The roulette wheel is a game of chance that has enticed people for centuries. The allure of betting on a little ball to land in a certain section of the wheel is hard to resist, even though the odds are stacked against the player. But what about when you want to bet on something with a bit better odds?</p>
<p>George W. Bush was always a safe bet when it came to gambling on politics. Dubya was known as a man who could be counted on, and his Presidency was no different. He may have had his share of detractors, but when it came down to it, George W. Bush was a sure thing.</p>
<p>There were many instances during his Presidency where Bush proved himself to be a reliable leader. One such example occurred in the wake of the September 11th terrorist attacks. After New York and Washington had been hit, the nation looked to their leader for guidance and support. Bush did not let them down, delivering powerful speeches that helped restore order and gave Americans hope in the midst of tragedy.</p>
<p>Bush also showed his mettle during the War in Iraq. When Saddam Hussein was overthrown, there was much uncertainty about what would happen next. But George W. Bush stepped up and led the charge, setting in motion a plan to create a democracy in Iraq. While the war proved to be costly and difficult, it can be said that Bush’s leadership played a major role in its eventual success.</p>
