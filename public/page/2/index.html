        <h1 id="France-Officially-Announces-Casino-Blackjack-Unit-Counting-Ban"><a href="#France-Officially-Announces-Casino-Blackjack-Unit-Counting-Ban" class="headerlink" title="France Officially Announces Casino Blackjack Unit Counting Ban"></a>France Officially Announces Casino Blackjack Unit Counting Ban</h1><p>In an attempt to curtail the use of advantage play in its casinos, France has announced a ban on players counting cards at blackjack tables. The new measure, which went into effect over the weekend, is intended to make it more difficult for cheaters to win at the game, and is part of a larger crackdown on casino cheating that began last year.</p>
<p>Under the new rules, casino employees are now allowed to ask players how they are keeping track of the cards, and those who refuse to answer or are found to be using forbidden methods can be kicked out of the casino. In addition, players caught counting cards can now be fined up to €5,000 (US$5,700).</p>
<p>Casino officials say they hope the new ban will make advantage play less profitable and ultimately discourage cheaters from targeting French casinos. While some players have expressed concern that the new rules will make it more difficult to win at blackjack, others say they are not overly concerned since card counting is not as effective with multiple decks.</p>
<p>The move by France comes as other countries around the world are also taking steps to combat casino cheating. In October 2017, for example, China announced plans to launch a nationwide crackdown on gambling crimes that include card counting.</p>
<h1 id="French-Casino-Crackdown-No-More-Unit-Counting"><a href="#French-Casino-Crackdown-No-More-Unit-Counting" class="headerlink" title="French Casino Crackdown: No More Unit Counting"></a>French Casino Crackdown: No More Unit Counting</h1><p>The French government is cracking down on casinos, with a new law banning the use of unit counting by players. The law, which came into effect on January 1st, 2019, is designed to stop what the government sees as cheating by players.</p>
<p>Casino operators have welcomed the move, saying that it will level the playing field and ensure that everyone is playing by the same rules. The ban on unit counting follows similar moves in other countries, including the United States and Australia.</p>
<p>Unit counting is a technique used by players to track how many high-value cards remain in the deck, in order to make informed betting decisions. By using this technique, players can bet more heavily when there are fewer high-value cards left in the deck, and vice versa.</p>
<p>Critics of unit counting say that it gives some players an unfair advantage over those who don’t use the technique. They argue that casinos should be able to set their own rules and that players should not be able to gain an edge by using advanced techniques.</p>
<p>Supporters of unit counting say that it is a legitimate way to play the game and that it helps level the playing field between novice and experienced players. They also argue that casinos have no right to ban techniques that players use legitimately to improve their chances of winning.</p>
<p>The new French law bans not just unit counting but also any other technique that gives players an edge over casino operators. This includes techniques such as card counting and edge sorting. Casino employees are now allowed to ask anyone suspected of using such techniques to leave the premises.</p>
<h1 id="France-prohibits-casino-blackjack-unit-counting"><a href="#France-prohibits-casino-blackjack-unit-counting" class="headerlink" title="France prohibits casino blackjack unit counting"></a>France prohibits casino blackjack unit counting</h1><p>France has taken a definitive stance against casino blackjack players who use card counting techniques to improve their odds of winning. The new decree, signed into law by Prime Minister Manuel Valls, imposes a €1,500 ($1,700) fine on any player caught counting cards at a French casino.</p>
<p>The new prohibition is the latest measure in a broad crackdown on gambling in France. Last year, the government banned online poker and began confiscating the assets of convicted gamblers. In addition, casino operators have been ordered to install more sophisticated surveillance equipment to detect cheating and money laundering.</p>
<p>The ban on blackjack card counting is likely motivated by concerns that the practice gives players an unfair advantage. Card counters keep track of the high and low cards played, allowing them to make better decisions about when to bet and when to fold. This can increase their chances of winning by as much as 5%.</p>
<p>Opponents of the ban argue that card counting is a legitimate strategy that should be allowed in a free and open society. They also point out that casinos have long used similar techniques to detect cheaters and prevent them from winning.</p>
<p>The new law goes into effect on July 1st, 2016.</p>
<h1 id="French-Casinos-Implement-New-Measures-to-Combat-Unit-Counting"><a href="#French-Casinos-Implement-New-Measures-to-Combat-Unit-Counting" class="headerlink" title="French Casinos Implement New Measures to Combat Unit Counting"></a>French Casinos Implement New Measures to Combat Unit Counting</h1><p>In what is seen as an effort to thwart cheating by professional players, French casinos have started using new measures to combat unit counting. The new system, which went into effect on January 1st, will require players to use a special chip to place their bets.</p>
<p>The chip, which is different in color and size from the regular chips used in the casino, will be automatically tracked by the casino’s computer system. This means that any changes in the bet quantity will be recorded, allowing casino personnel to detect any attempts at cheating by counting units.</p>
<p>Casino operators believe that the new system will help them protect their profits and ensure a fair gaming experience for all players. Professional players, however, are already finding ways around the new measures.</p>
<p>One technique being used is to split bets between different colored chips. This makes it more difficult for the casino’s computer system to track individual bet quantities, and can make it difficult for casino staff to determine if a player is trying to cheat.</p>
<p>Professional players are also said to be using special software programs that help them count units while playing online casinos games. This allows them to take advantage of bonuses and other promotions offered by online casinos without having to worry about getting caught cheating.</p>
<p>Despite these efforts, casino operators remain confident that the new measures will help them reduce cheating by professional players.</p>
<h1 id="Unions-Threaten-Strike-as-France-toughens-stance-on-casino-blackjack-unit-counting"><a href="#Unions-Threaten-Strike-as-France-toughens-stance-on-casino-blackjack-unit-counting" class="headerlink" title="Unions Threaten Strike as France toughens stance on casino blackjack unit counting"></a>Unions Threaten Strike as France toughens stance on casino blackjack unit counting</h1><p>Unions representing some 2,000 casino workers in France are threatening to go on strike after the government toughened its stance on blackjack card counting.</p>
<p>The new measures would see dealers forced to keep track of each card played, making it more difficult for players to count them and gain an advantage over the house.</p>
<p>In a statement, the Unsa and CGT unions said they “strongly condemn the government’s decision which will only lead to more unemployment in a sector that is already in difficulty”.</p>
<p>The unions argue that the new measures will make it harder for casinos to compete with neighbouring countries such as Belgium and Switzerland, where counting cards is not currently illegal.</p>
<p>“This decision…will penalise our casinos at a time when they are already struggling against competition from abroad,” they said.</p>
<p>“We call on the government to withdraw this project and we reserve the right to go on strike.”</p>

<li>She is constantly making excuses about why she lost money or needs more money.</li>
<li>She has been borrowing money from you or other family members on a regular basis.</li>

Here are some suggestions for how to get started.</p>
<p>First, it’s important to understand that gambling is a serious addiction that can have harmful consequences for both the gambler and those around them. If you think your Mom might have a problem, it’s important to talk to her about it and encourage her to seek help.</p>
<p>There are many resources available for people with gambling problems, including counseling, support groups, and addiction treatment programs. The National Council on Problem Gambling provides a directory of these programs [1] , which is a good place to start.</p>
<p>If your Mom is unwilling or unable to seek help on her own, you can try reaching out to one of the organizations listed below. They can provide advice and assistance in getting your Mom the help she needs.</p>
<ul>
<li><a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.gamblersanonymous.org/">Gamblers Anonymous</a> - Gamblers Anonymous is a 12-step program for people with gambling problems.

You may feel like you are powerless to help them, but there are things you can do to support your mom and help her get the treatment she needs.</p>
<p>If your mom is having difficulty stopping gambling, the first step is to talk to her about it. Remind her that you love her and want to help her, but be honest about how her gambling is affecting you and other family members. Let her know that you don’t think she is capable of stopping on her own and that she needs professional help.</p>
<p>If your mom is willing to seek treatment, the next step is finding the right program for her. There are many different types of programs available, so it’s important to find one that fits her specific needs. Some programs focus on Gamblers Anonymous meetings, while others offer residential or outpatient treatment.</p>
<p>Once your mom has started treatment, it’s important to stay supportive. Attend all of the therapy sessions and support groups if possible, and be there for your mom when she needs you. Gambling addiction can be a difficult addiction to overcome, but with your support, your mom can beat it.</p>

        <h1 id="Online-Millionaire-Proves-Gambling-Isn’t-A-Game"><a href="#Online-Millionaire-Proves-Gambling-Isn’t-A-Game" class="headerlink" title="Online Millionaire Proves Gambling Isn’t A Game"></a>Online Millionaire Proves Gambling Isn’t A Game</h1><p>Everyone has heard the saying that “gambling is a game of chance.” But according to one online millionaire, that’s not actually true.</p>
<p>In an interview with ABC News, Shawn Nguyen revealed that he had made over $1 million from online gambling. And he did it by playing intelligently and strategically, not just by luck.</p>
<p>“A lot of people think that gambling is all about luck, but that’s not true at all,” Nguyen said. “There’s a lot of skill and strategy involved in gambling, and if you know what you’re doing, you can make a lot of money.”</p>
<p>Nguyen first got interested in online gambling when he was just 18 years old. At the time, he was working as a waiter in a restaurant and he wanted to find a way to make more money. He started researching online casinos and studying different strategies for winning.</p>
<p>And it paid off. Nguyen quickly became an expert gambler and started making thousands of dollars every month from blackjack, roulette, and other games. In fact, he eventually became so successful that he quit his job at the restaurant and started doing gambling full-time.</p>
<p>Now 27 years old, Nguyen is living proof that gambling isn’t just a game of chance – it’s a game of skill and strategy too. If you want to be a successful gambler, you need to learn how to play the games properly and use sound betting strategies.</p>
<h1 id="Slot-Machine-King-Keeps-Winning-With-Strategy"><a href="#Slot-Machine-King-Keeps-Winning-With-Strategy" class="headerlink" title="Slot Machine King Keeps Winning With Strategy"></a>Slot Machine King Keeps Winning With Strategy</h1><p>Casinos don’t like it when their slot machines are being beaten by customers. But one man has figured out how to consistently win at slots, and the casinos can do nothing about it.</p>
<p>Meet Slot Machine King, a 62-year-old man from California who has won over $1 million at slots by using a simple strategy. Slot Machine King first learned how to beat slots while he was in prison. He watched other inmates play and learned their strategies.</p>
<p>Now that he’s out of prison, Slot Machine King continues to use the same strategy to win at slots. His method is simple: he always plays the maximum number of coins on each spin, regardless of the odds. This gives him a better chance of winning, since the jackpot is proportionate to the number of coins played.</p>
<p>Slot Machine King isn’t the only person who has figured out how to beat slots. There are countless articles and websites online that teach people how to win at slots. But most of these strategies require players to make complicated calculations or guess which symbols will come up next.</p>
<p>Slot Machine King’s strategy is much simpler: just play the maximum number of coins on every spin!</p>

        <h1 id="What-Collection-Do-You-Report-Gambling-Profits-Online-Casino"><a href="#What-Collection-Do-You-Report-Gambling-Profits-Online-Casino" class="headerlink" title="What Collection Do You Report Gambling Profits Online Casino?"></a>What Collection Do You Report Gambling Profits Online Casino?</h1><p>There are many different types of gambling, each with its own unique set of rules and regulations. What this means for taxpayers is that there is no one-size-fits-all answer to the question of which gambling profits need to be reported on your taxes.</p>
<p>Below we will provide a brief overview of the most common types of gambling, as well as instructions on how to report your gambling winnings and losses. Remember, if you have any questions contact a professional tax advisor who can help you determine which specific activities need to be disclosed on your tax return.</p>
<p>Casino Gambling</p>
<p>Gambling income from casinos (including racetracks) must be reported on your tax return. This includes not just profits from slot machines or card games, but also any cash or value won from bonuses or complimentary gifts (like free rooms or meals).</p>
<p>To report casino gambling income, you will need to complete Form 1040, Schedule C, Profit or Loss from Business. On Line 31 of Schedule C enter the total amount of your winnings from casino gambling. If you have any losses, you can deduct these on Line 28 of Schedule C.</p>
<p>Lottery Winnings</p>
<p>Lottery winnings are considered taxable income and must be reported on your tax return. The amount you report will depend on the total value of your prize. If the prize is less than $600, it does not need to be reported on your tax return. However, if the prize is more than $600, you will need to complete Form 1040, Schedule A and include the amount of your winnings in Box 3.</p>
<p>If you are like most Americans and opt to receive your lottery winnings in installments over time, you will still need to report the entire value of the prize in the year it was won. This is true even if you choose not to receive all of the installments in that year. For example, if you win a $1 million lottery but choose to take $100,000 annually for 10 years, you will still need to report $1 million as income in the year you won the lottery.</p>
<p>Horse Racing Gambling<br>Bets or wagers placed on horse racing are considered taxable income and must be reported on your tax return. The amount you report will depend on whether or not you won or lost money on those bets. To figure out your net profit or loss from horse racing gambling, subtract any expenses related to that activity from your gross earnings (winnings + bonuses + commissions). This difference is then included on Line 21 of Form 1040, Schedule 1 (Other Income). If there was a net loss for the year, it can be deducted from other sources of income on Line 33 of Schedule 1.</p>
<h1 id="How-To-Report-Gambling-Winnings-From-Online-Casino"><a href="#How-To-Report-Gambling-Winnings-From-Online-Casino" class="headerlink" title="How To Report Gambling Winnings From Online Casino"></a>How To Report Gambling Winnings From Online Casino</h1><p>If you’re lucky enough to score some big wins from an online casino, you’ll need to report those winnings on your tax return. Here’s what you need to know about gambling income and taxes.</p>
<p>Gambling Income and Taxes</p>
<p>Just like any other form of income, gambling winnings are subject to income taxes. The amount you owe in taxes will depend on how much money you earn and your tax bracket.</p>
<p>In order to report your gambling income, you’ll need to keep track of all of your winnings and losses. This can be done using a log or a tracking spreadsheet. You should also save all of your casino withdrawal slips and betting logs.</p>
<p>Reporting Winnings</p>
<p>When it comes time to file your taxes, you’ll need to report all of your gambling income. This includes both winning and losing bets. You should list the total amount of gambling income on Line 21 of your Form 1040. If you have losses, you can deduct those losses on Line 27 of the form.</p>
<p>You’ll also need to report any federal taxes that have been withheld from your winnings. This information can be found on Form W-2G, which is issued by the casino when you cash out your winnings. You should include this amount on Line 62 of Form 1040.</p>
<p>Taxes and Online Casinos</p>
<p>Since online casinos are based in different countries, their taxes may vary. In some cases, the casino may withhold taxes from your winnings before issuing them to you. It’s important to research the tax laws for the country where the casino is located.</p>
<h1 id="Which-Form-Do-I-File-For-Gambling-Winnings-From-Online-Casino"><a href="#Which-Form-Do-I-File-For-Gambling-Winnings-From-Online-Casino" class="headerlink" title="Which Form Do I File For Gambling Winnings From Online Casino?"></a>Which Form Do I File For Gambling Winnings From Online Casino?</h1><p>When you hit a winning streak while gambling online, the question of how to report those winnings becomes important. You might not be sure if you are supposed to claim the money on your taxes or if there is some other process you need to follow. The good news is that gambling income is taxable in the United States, but there are a few things you need to know about reporting it.</p>
<p>The first thing to do is determine if the winnings are considered taxable income. This will depend on the amount of money you won and how it was earned. Gambling income includes payouts from casino games, lotteries, and race tracks, as well as any prizes or awards you receive from gambling. Winnings from raffles or contests are not typically considered taxable income, however.</p>
<p>If the winnings are taxable, then you will need to report them on your tax return. You will need to file Form 1040 and indicate the amount of your winnings on Line 21 of that form. You can also use Schedule A to itemize your deductions and include the gambling income there. If you do not have enough other deductions to itemize, then you can use Form 1040A or 1040EZ instead and simply enter the gambling income on Line 21.</p>
<p>There are a few things to keep in mind when reporting gambling income. First, you can only claim losses up to the amount of your winnings. So if you won $1,000 but lost $2,000 while gambling, you can only claim a loss of $1,000 on your taxes. Additionally, gambling income is subject to self-employment tax. This means that you will need to pay both Social Security and Medicare taxes on it.</p>
<p>Reporting gambling income can be confusing, but it is important that you do so correctly. The IRS has specific rules for how this type of income should be reported, so make sure to consult with a tax professional if you have any questions about it. By following these simple guidelines, you can make sure that your gambling winnings are correctly reported on your tax return</p>
<h1 id="What-Happens-If-I-Don’t-Report-My-Gambling-Winnings-From-Online-Casino"><a href="#What-Happens-If-I-Don’t-Report-My-Gambling-Winnings-From-Online-Casino" class="headerlink" title="What Happens If I Don’t Report My Gambling Winnings From Online Casino?"></a>What Happens If I Don’t Report My Gambling Winnings From Online Casino?</h1><p>Online gambling comes with a lot of risks and one of the biggest is not reporting your gambling winnings. It’s important to understand the consequences if you don’t report your gambling winnings.</p>
<p>When you gamble online, you’re required to report any and all winnings. This is because gambling is considered taxable income in the United States. If you don’t report your gambling winnings, you could face significant penalties from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS).</p>
<p>The penalties for not reporting your gambling winnings can be quite severe. You could be charged with tax evasion, which is a felony offense. You could also face civil penalties from the IRS. These penalties can include a fine of up to 50% of the amount of money you failed to report, plus interest.</p>
<p>In addition to facing penalties from the IRS, you could also face criminal charges if you don’t report your gambling winnings. This means you could go to jail for not reporting your winnings.</p>
<p>It’s important to remember that the IRS takes failure to report gambling winnings very seriously. If you don’t report your winnings, you could end up facing significant penalties from both the IRS and law enforcement. It’s always best to play it safe and report all of your gambling winnings.</p>
<h1 id="How-To-Avoid-Paying-Taxes-On-Your-Gambling-Winnings-From-An-Online-Casino"><a href="#How-To-Avoid-Paying-Taxes-On-Your-Gambling-Winnings-From-An-Online-Casino" class="headerlink" title="How To Avoid Paying Taxes On Your Gambling Winnings From An Online Casino"></a>How To Avoid Paying Taxes On Your Gambling Winnings From An Online Casino</h1><p>In most cases, if you gamble and win money, the IRS is going to want a piece of that action. But there are some instances where you can avoid paying taxes on your gambling wins. In this article we’ll explore a few of those methods and show you how to stay in the clear with the taxman.</p>
<p>The first way to avoid paying taxes on your gambling winnings is to only gamble with funds that you can afford to lose. This may seem like common sense, but many people get caught up in the excitement of casino gambling and end up spending more money than they can afford. If you stick to gambling with money you can afford to lose, any profits you make are considered taxable income.</p>
<p>Another way to avoid paying taxes on your gambling winnings is to only gamble in a foreign country. The IRS doesn’t tax gambling income earned outside of the United States. So as long as all your gambling takes place in a foreign country, any profits you make are tax-free.</p>
<p>There is one big caveat though: You have to be able to prove that all your gambling took place in a foreign country. This can be tricky, since casinos often keep records of player activity. If the IRS audits you and finds out that some or all of your gambling took place in the U.S., they will expect you to pay taxes on those winnings.</p>
<p>The third way to avoid paying taxes on your gambling winnings is by claiming them as business losses. If you can prove that your gambling was part of a legitimate business venture, any losses incurred can be used to offset other taxable income. This strategy only works if you have documentation supporting your claim that your gambling was for business purposes. Records such as bank statements and invoices can help legitimize your case with the IRS.</p>
<p>One final way to avoid paying taxes on your gambling winnings is by taking advantage of the Casualty and Theft Loss deduction. This provision allows taxpayers to deduct their losses from theft or casualty events, including losses from gambling accidents. To qualify for this deduction, the event must have occurred while you were carrying on a trade or business or during recreation or amusement (gambling falls under this category). The deduction is limited to the amount of taxable income reduced by $100 per casualty or theft event. So if you have $1,000 in taxable income and suffer three separate casualties/thefts during the year, your deduction would be limited to $200 ($100 per event).</p>
<p>As you can see, there are several ways to avoid paying taxes on your gambling wins from an online casino . Just make sure you consult with an accountant or tax specialistto find out which method is best foryou.”</p>

        <h1 id="Vegas-Magic-to-Allow-More-Video-Wagering-Machines"><a href="#Vegas-Magic-to-Allow-More-Video-Wagering-Machines" class="headerlink" title="Vegas Magic to Allow More Video Wagering Machines"></a>Vegas Magic to Allow More Video Wagering Machines</h1><p>Las Vegas is a place for casinos and games of chance. But what about video gambling?</p>
<p>While Sin City has been generally opposed to increased video gambling machines, that may all be changing. The Nevada Gaming Commission has given the green light to MGM Resorts International to increase the number of its video wagering machines at the Bellagio, Circus Circus, and Mirage resorts in Las Vegas.</p>
<p>MGM already operates 1,800 such machines in Nevada, but it will now be allowed to install an additional 2,500. That’s good news for the company, which has seen revenues from its casino operations decline in recent years.</p>
<p>The decision by the gaming commission comes as other casino operators are pushing for similar approvals. Wynn Resorts is seeking permission to install another 500 video wagering machines, and Caesars Entertainment wants to add 1,500.</p>
<p>Overall, there are now about 25,000 such machines in Nevada, and industry analysts expect that number to grow rapidly in the coming years.</p>
<h1 id="Vegas-Magic-Casinos-Widens-its-Presence-in-the-Gambling-Industry"><a href="#Vegas-Magic-Casinos-Widens-its-Presence-in-the-Gambling-Industry" class="headerlink" title="Vegas Magic Casinos Widens its Presence in the Gambling Industry"></a>Vegas Magic Casinos Widens its Presence in the Gambling Industry</h1><p>In the gambling world, Vegas Magic Casinos has been widening its presence. The gambling company has been on a buying spree, acquiring different casinos in order to establish a stronghold in the industry. This aggressive move by Vegas Magic seems to be paying off, as their profits have gone up in recent years.</p>
<p>The company started out by acquiring two small casinos in 2016. However, they have since bought several larger casinos, including a casino in Atlantic City. This increase in size has helped them to become one of the top five companies in the gambling industry.</p>
<p>The growth of Vegas Magic is not just limited to their acquisitions; they have also been expanding their operations internationally. They have opened a casino in Macau and are planning to open more in other countries.</p>
<p>All this expansion has been funded by the surging profits of Vegas Magic. In 2017, their profits were up by 50%, and they are expecting even more growth this year. This highlights the growing popularity of Vegas Magic and their ability to dominate the gambling industry.</p>
<h1 id="More-Gaming-Options-for-Customers-of-Vegas-Magic"><a href="#More-Gaming-Options-for-Customers-of-Vegas-Magic" class="headerlink" title="More Gaming Options for Customers of Vegas Magic"></a>More Gaming Options for Customers of Vegas Magic</h1><p>Gamers in Las Vegas now have more choices when they want to game. Vegas Magic, a gaming lounge on the Strip, has announced that it is adding new gaming consoles to its repertoire. Gamers can now play the latest games on the PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.</p>
<p>The addition of these new consoles is part of Vegas Magic’s commitment to giving gamers the best possible experience. “We’re always looking for ways to improve our lounge and give our customers the best possible gaming experience,” said Lonnie Garber, manager of Vegas Magic. “Adding the latest gaming consoles is one way we’re doing that.”</p>
<p>In addition to the new consoles, Vegas Magic has also announced a slate of new games that will be available for play. These games include Grand Theft Auto V, Call of Duty: Advanced Warfare, FIFA 15, and Madden NFL 15. “We’re really excited about all of the new games that are coming out,” said Garber. “Our customers are going to love them.”</p>
<p>Vegas Magic is also adding a number of new features to its lounge. These features include a remodeled dining area, new furniture, and an updated sound system. The goal is to make the lounge more comfortable and inviting for gamers. “We want gamers to feel like they’re at home when they come here,” said Garber. “These new features will help us achieve that goal.”</p>
<p>The addition of the PlayStation 4 and Xbox One is good news for gamers in Las Vegas. It means that they now have more options when it comes to where they can play their favorite games. In addition, it means that they can enjoy the newest games on the latest consoles.</p>
<h1 id="Increased-Video-Wagering-at-Vegas-Magic-Locations"><a href="#Increased-Video-Wagering-at-Vegas-Magic-Locations" class="headerlink" title="Increased Video Wagering at Vegas Magic Locations"></a>Increased Video Wagering at Vegas Magic Locations</h1><p>In the past year, there has been a noticeable increase in video gambling at Las Vegas magic locations. This uptick can be attributed to new technological advancements that allow players to gamble on sporting events and other video content in real time.</p>
<p>The origins of this type of wagering can be traced back to a London bookmaker’s office in the early 1800s. At that time, those who wagered on race results would place their bets with the runner who was assigned to take the bets to the track. In order to speed up this process, the runner would make a note of all the bets he accepted on a piece of paper which he would then hand over to the bookie when he returned from the track. It was from this practice that we get the term “bookmaking”.</p>
<p>Fast forward to the 21st century and we now have online sportsbooks where people can bet on games as they are being played. However, due to stricter regulation and increases in legal fees, sports betting is currently only available in a handful of U.S. states. This has not stopped people from wagering on sports as around 97% of all illegal sports betting takes place outside of regulated markets.</p>
<p>This is where video gambling comes into play as it allows people to bet on things other than sports, such as current events or reality TV shows. For example, during last year’s World Cup, several Las Vegas magic locations had stations set up where people could bet on who would win each match. This type of wagering is also growing in popularity for major horse races such as the Kentucky Derby and Breeders’ Cup Classic.</p>
<p>While many people view video gambling as a harmless way to pass the time, there are others who believe that it is nothing more than an addiction-driven form of gambling which can lead to financial ruin. As with any form of gambling, it is important to remember that there is always risk involved and that you should never gamble more than you can afford to lose</p>

        <h1 id="Gamblers-in-Wyoming-can-now-claim-their-losses-on-Fanduel"><a href="#Gamblers-in-Wyoming-can-now-claim-their-losses-on-Fanduel" class="headerlink" title="Gamblers in Wyoming can now claim their losses on Fanduel!"></a>Gamblers in Wyoming can now claim their losses on Fanduel!</h1><p>In March of this year, the state of Wyoming legalized gambling losses on Fanduel and similar fantasy sports websites. This means that anyone who lives in Wyoming and gambles on Fanduel can now write off their losses on their taxes.</p>
<p>This is great news for gamblers in Wyoming, as it will allow them to get a little bit of their money back from the government. It is also good news for Fanduel, as it will likely bring in more customers from Wyoming.</p>
<p>This new law is likely to be popular in other states as well. There are many people who enjoy gambling, and being able to write off those losses on their taxes can be very helpful.</p>
<p>Of course, there are some restrictions on who can claim these losses. The person must have actually lost money while gambling, and they cannot use this deduction to reduce their taxable income below zero. But overall, this is a welcome change for gamblers in the United States.</p>
<h1 id="Gambling-losses-through-Fanduel-can-now-be-claimed-in-Wyoming"><a href="#Gambling-losses-through-Fanduel-can-now-be-claimed-in-Wyoming" class="headerlink" title="Gambling losses through Fanduel can now be claimed in Wyoming!"></a>Gambling losses through Fanduel can now be claimed in Wyoming!</h1><p>According to the new law that has been recently introduced in Wyoming, gambling losses through Fanduel and any other fantasy sports platforms can now be claimed as tax deductions. It is said that this new law will help in boosting the economy of Wyoming, while also providing relief to the taxpayers.</p>
<p>This move by the state of Wyoming is being welcomed by many, as it provides a way for people to claim some of their lost money back. It is estimated that around $5 million was gambled away in the state last year, and a good chunk of this amount could now be used to offset taxes.</p>
<p>While there are some who are skeptical about the new law, arguing that it will only encourage more gambling, there are many others who feel that it is a step in the right direction. It will be interesting to see how this plays out and if other states follow suit.</p>
<h1 id="Wyoming-residents-can-now-claim-gambling-losses-on-Fanduel"><a href="#Wyoming-residents-can-now-claim-gambling-losses-on-Fanduel" class="headerlink" title="Wyoming residents can now claim gambling losses on Fanduel!"></a>Wyoming residents can now claim gambling losses on Fanduel!</h1><p>According to a new ruling in the state of Wyoming, residents can now claim gambling losses on their taxes related to Fanduel and other fantasy sports betting sites. The ruling, which was made by the state’s Department of Revenue, states that any losses incurred while betting on fantasy sports games can be deducted from taxable income.</p>
<p>This is great news for Wyoming residents who enjoy betting on fantasy sports games, as it allows them to recoup some of their losses and potentially reduce their tax bill. It’s also good news for Fanduel and other fantasy sports sites, as it legitimizes their business in the eyes of the government and could lead to more people using their services.</p>
<p>The ruling is likely to be closely watched by other states, as it could set a precedent for how gambling losses are treated when it comes to taxes. For now though, Wyoming residents can rejoice knowing that they can now get some relief for their gambling losses.</p>
<h1 id="Did-you-know-that-gambling-losses-through-Fanduel-are-tax-deductible-in-Wyoming"><a href="#Did-you-know-that-gambling-losses-through-Fanduel-are-tax-deductible-in-Wyoming" class="headerlink" title="Did you know that gambling losses through Fanduel are tax deductible in Wyoming?"></a>Did you know that gambling losses through Fanduel are tax deductible in Wyoming?</h1><p>For those of you who are avid Fanduel players, you may be interested in knowing that your gambling losses are tax deductible in Wyoming. According to the Wyoming Department of Revenue, as long as you can prove that your losses are greater than your winnings, you can deduct them on your state income tax return.</p>
<p>So how do you go about proving that your losses are greater than your winnings? The easiest way is to keep track of your records. Make sure to record the date of each game, the amount of money you bet, as well as the outcome. This information will help you calculate your losses and wins accurately.</p>
<p>If you don’t have records to back up your claims, you may still be able to claim a deduction if you can provide other evidence that supports your case. This could include documentation such as canceled checks, bank statements, or even credit card statements.</p>
<p>While gambling losses are generally tax deductible, there are a few exceptions. For example, you can’t deduct losses if they were incurred in connection with illegal activities. And if you’re subject to IRS audit, you will likely need to provide documentation to support your deductions.</p>
<p>So if you’re a Fanduel player and you live in Wyoming, be sure to take advantage of the state’s gambling loss deduction!</p>
<h1 id="Gambling-losses-on-Fanduel-are-now-deductible-in-the-state-of-Wyoming"><a href="#Gambling-losses-on-Fanduel-are-now-deductible-in-the-state-of-Wyoming" class="headerlink" title="Gambling losses on Fanduel are now deductible in the state of Wyoming!"></a>Gambling losses on Fanduel are now deductible in the state of Wyoming!</h1><p>Fanduel, the popular sports betting platform, announced on Wednesday that gambling losses incurred on its site are now deductible in the state of Wyoming. Mark Block, a spokesman for the company, said in a statement that the move is an effort to “support responsible gaming and provide our customers with transparency and accountability.”</p>
<p>The news was welcomed by many gamblers in Wyoming, who had long lobbied for the change. J.D. Hickey, a resident of Cheyenne and regular Fanduel player, said that he was “thrilled” to hear the change had been made.</p>
<p>“For years I’ve been arguing that gambling losses should be tax deductible,” said Hickey. “It’s great to see that Fanduel has finally recognized this and is doing something about it.”</p>
<p>Under IRS rules, gambling losses are only deductible if they exceed the amount of gambling income earned. For most people, this isn’t a problem, but for high-rollers who incur large losses year after year, it can be difficult to claim the deduction. The new policy from Fanduel should make it easier for those people to offset their losses against their taxable income.</p>
<p>Not everyone is happy with the move, however. Some experts argue that it could lead to more people gambling irresponsibly and incurring even larger losses. “This is likely to be a disaster for a lot of people,” said one analyst speaking on condition of anonymity. “It could easily lead to even more bankruptcies and financial ruin than we’ve already seen from gambling addiction.”</p>
<p>Despite these concerns, most experts agree that the change is a positive step for both gamblers and Fanduel alike. With more and more states moving towards legalized sports betting, it is likely that other platforms will follow suit and offer similar tax deductions to their customers.</p>

        <h1 id="So-Why-Did-Booth-Start-Gambling-Once-More-On-Bones"><a href="#So-Why-Did-Booth-Start-Gambling-Once-More-On-Bones" class="headerlink" title="So Why Did Booth Start Gambling Once More On Bones?"></a>So Why Did Booth Start Gambling Once More On Bones?</h1><p>It is Season 10 episode 14 of the TV series Bones and we find out Booth is gambling again. This time, his partner Brennan confronts him about it. So what could have led to this relapse?</p>
<p>There are a few potential explanations. One possibility is that Booth is feeling overwhelmed and struggling with the change in his life since he returned from prison. He has a new job, a new home and a new fiancée, all of which are a lot for him to take on. It’s possible that gambling was a way for him to cope with the stress.</p>
<p>Another possibility is that Booth may be feeling isolated from his friends and family since he’s been out of prison. His old network of buddies may have been criminal associates and he may no longer have those same connections now that he’s trying to live a law-abiding life. Gambling could be a way for him to feel like he’s still part of something.</p>
<p>Finally, it’s possible that Booth is using gambling as a way to deal with his feelings about his daughter. He was only able to see her sporadically while he was in prison and they’ve had a difficult relationship since he’s been released. Gambling could be a way for him to numb the pain of not being able to properly connect with his daughter.</p>
<p>No matter what the reason, it’s clear that Booth needs help and he needs to address whatever underlying issues are driving him to gamble again. If he doesn’t get help, his gambling could spiral out of control and cause serious consequences in his life.</p>
<h1 id="Bones-Booth-Gambler-or-Addict"><a href="#Bones-Booth-Gambler-or-Addict" class="headerlink" title="Bones Booth: Gambler or Addict?"></a>Bones Booth: Gambler or Addict?</h1><p>In the hit show Bones, lead character FBI agent Seeley Booth is depicted as a muscle-bound gambler with a quick temper. But is this characterization accurate?</p>
<p>The real Booth was actually an Army sniper and a college graduate who suffered from depression. So what exactly drove him to gamble?</p>
<p>It’s possible that Booth’s gambling was fueled by his addiction to risk-taking. This addiction may have been born out of his need for excitement and adrenaline rushes, which he likely got from his time in the military and as an FBI agent.</p>
<p>Booth’s gambling also likely served as a form of self-medication. He may have used it to cope with his depression or to try and forget about his traumatic experiences.</p>
<p>Whatever the case may be, Booth’s gambling addiction was likely a major factor in his life and significantly impacted his relationships with others.</p>
<h1 id="What-Drives-Booth-To-Gamble-Again-On-Bones"><a href="#What-Drives-Booth-To-Gamble-Again-On-Bones" class="headerlink" title="What Drives Booth To Gamble Again On Bones?"></a>What Drives Booth To Gamble Again On Bones?</h1><p>Fans of the crime show “Bones” were thrilled when the show was resurrected for a 12th season this year. The season premiere, however, left some fans with more questions than answers. In the episode, Booth (played by David Boreanaz) is gambling again and seems to be in denial about his addiction. What could have driven him to gamble again after years of sobriety?</p>
<p>There are a few possible explanations for Booth’s behavior. One possibility is that he is feeling overwhelmed by the new changes in his life. He has a new baby with Brennan (played by Emily Deschanel) and is also working on a new case at the FBI. It’s possible that he turned to gambling as a way to cope with the stress of it all.</p>
<p>Another possibility is that Booth’s gambling addiction never went away completely. It’s possible that he only managed to stay sober for as long as he did because he was focused on his work and family. But when those things weren’t enough anymore, he turned back to gambling as a way to escape from his problems.</p>
<p>Whatever the reason for Booth’s relapse, it will be interesting to see how it affects his relationship with Brennan and the rest of the team at the FBI.</p>
<h1 id="Why-Is-Booth-Returning-To-Gambling-On-Bones"><a href="#Why-Is-Booth-Returning-To-Gambling-On-Bones" class="headerlink" title="Why Is Booth Returning To Gambling On Bones?"></a>Why Is Booth Returning To Gambling On Bones?</h1><p>It has been more than a year since Booth (David Boreanaz) was last seen gambling on Bones (Fox, Mondays at 8/7c), but in this Monday’s episode, “The puzzle in the air,” he’s back to his old ways. So why is he returning to gambling?</p>
<p>“The puzzle in the air” is the 12th episode of Bones’ 11th season, and it finds Booth investigating a murder that occurred at a casino. The victim was a gambler, and Booth is determined to find out who killed him.</p>
<p>In order to do that, he’ll need to get close to the casino’s employees and customers - which means gambling again. As he says in the episode, “Gambling is like riding a bike; you never forget how to do it.”</p>
<p>It’s been a while since we’ve seen Booth gamble on Bones, but it’s clear from this episode that he still knows how to do it. He may have been away from the casino for a while, but that doesn’t mean he’s lost his touch.</p>
<p>Booth has always been good at gambling, and this episode shows that he hasn’t lost his edge. He may not be able to solve the murder on his own, but with his skills as a gambler, he’ll definitely be able to get close to the suspects.</p>
<h1 id="Bones-Booth-Struggles-With-Gambling-Addiction"><a href="#Bones-Booth-Struggles-With-Gambling-Addiction" class="headerlink" title="Bones Booth Struggles With Gambling Addiction"></a>Bones Booth Struggles With Gambling Addiction</h1><p>It was difficult for Bones Booth to admit that he had a gambling addiction. He had always been a high-stakes gambler, and it was a habit that he found difficult to break. In the early days of his addiction, Booth would often lose money gambling, but he would always make up for it by winning more later on. However, as his addiction grew worse, Booth began to lose more money than he could win back. This led to him falling into debt and causing significant problems in his personal life.</p>

<p>Booth struggled to keep up with his bills, and he began to miss payments on his car and house. His relationship with his wife also began to suffer, as she was not happy with the amount of time he was spending at the casino. Eventually, Booth’s addiction became too much for him to handle and he sought help from a rehabilitation centre.</p>
<p>At the rehab centre, Booth learned about the dangers of gambling addiction and how to overcome it. He also worked on repairing his relationships with his wife and children. After completing the programme, Booth was determined to stay away from gambling and rebuild his life. He has been successful so far and is now a more productive member of society.</p>

The amount of tax they must pay varies from state to state. In New York, for example, bookmakers are required to pay a percentage of their gross income in tax. This article will explore how much tax bookmakers must pay in New York and some of the factors that influence this amount.</p>
<p>Bookmakers in New York are required to pay an 8.82% tax on their gross income. This is one of the highest tax rates in the country and it applies to all types of bookmakers, including those who accept bets online or over the phone. There are some factors that can influence the amount of tax a bookmaker pays, such as their total income and the type of bets they accept.</p>
<p>In addition to the 8.82% tax, there is also a 0.5% horse racing surcharge that bookmakers must pay in New York. This surcharge is used to support the state’s horse racing industry. So, in total, bookmakers in New York must pay a 9.32% tax on their gross income.</p>
<p>There are some exemptions from this tax rate, however. For example, if a bookmaker only accepts bets on sporting events that take place outside of New York, they are not required to pay the 8.82% tax rate. Additionally, if a bettor places a bet with a licensed off-track betting facility, the bettor is not subject to any taxes on that bet.</p>
<p>So, how does this 9.32% tax rate compare to other states? Well, it’s actually one of the highest in the country. In Nevada, for example, bookmakers only have to pay a 2% tax on their gross income. And in Delaware, bookmakers only have to pay a 0.5% tax rate on their gross income. So, why is New York’s rate so much higher?</p>
<p>One reason could be because New York is trying to protect its own gambling industry from competition from other states. By imposing high taxes on bookmakers’ incomes, New York can make it less attractive for them to do business in the state. This could ultimately help protect New York’s own gambling businesses from being shut down by out-of-state competition.</p>
<h1 id="How-Is-Gambling-Taxed-In-New-York"><a href="#How-Is-Gambling-Taxed-In-New-York" class="headerlink" title="How Is Gambling Taxed In New York?"></a>How Is Gambling Taxed In New York?</h1><p>As a New Yorker, you may be wondering how gambling is taxed in the state. Here is a brief overview of the tax laws related to gambling in New York.</p>
<p>Gambling income is generally taxable in New York. This includes income from lottery winnings, casino games, and betting or wagering. Gambling losses may also be deductible, subject to certain limitations.</p>
<p>If you win a lottery prize or other gambling payout, the entire amount will be taxable. If you win a jackpot worth $5,000 or more, the payer will issue you a Form W-2G indicating the amount of the winnings and any federal taxes that have been withheld.</p>
<p>Casino winnings are also subject to income tax in New York. The casino will report your winnings on a Form W-2G, and the full amount will be subject to New York taxes. However, you can deduct your losses up to the amount of your winnings. So if you have $1,000 in net wins from casino games, and $500 in losses, only $500 of your casino income will be taxable in New York.</p>
<p>Gambling income from betting or wagering is also subject to income tax in New York. The person or business that pays out the winning bet or wager will report the payout on a Form W-2G. The full amount of the payout will be subject to tax, with no deductions allowed for losses.</p>
<h1 id="What-Is-The-Tax-Rate-For-Gambling-Winnings-In-New-York"><a href="#What-Is-The-Tax-Rate-For-Gambling-Winnings-In-New-York" class="headerlink" title="What Is The Tax Rate For Gambling Winnings In New York?"></a>What Is The Tax Rate For Gambling Winnings In New York?</h1><p>The New York state tax rate for gambling winnings is 8.82%. This is a bit higher than the national average of 7.65%. There are a few different ways to figure out how much you will have to pay in taxes on your gambling winnings.</p>
<p>First, you will want to determine the amount of your winnings. This can be done by subtracting the amount you wagered from the amount you won. In addition, you will need to report all of your gambling winnings on your tax return. This includes winnings from casinos, lotteries, raffles and any other type of gambling activity.</p>
<p>If you have gambling losses, you can deduct them from your taxable income. However, you cannot deduct more than the amount of your gambling winnings. Gambling losses can be deducted whether or not you itemize deductions on your tax return.</p>
<p>There are a few things to keep in mind when filing taxes on your gambling winnings. First, only taxable income is subject to tax. This means that any money that was withheld for taxes or that was paid for losses can be subtracted from your total gambling winnings. In addition, certain states do not charge taxes on gambling winnings.</p>
<p>It is also important to note that not all types of gambling are taxed at the same rate. For example, state income taxes usually do not apply to lottery prizes, but they do apply to casino and other types of gaming wins. Be sure to check with your state’s Department of Revenue to determine the specific tax rates for different types of gambling activities.</p>
<p>The bottom line is that if you gamble and happen to win, there is a good chance that you will have to pay taxes on those gains. However, it’s always a good idea to speak with a tax professional to get specific advice about how these rules apply to your individual situation</p>

The good news is that they are taxed at a relatively low rate. The bad news is that there are a few catches that you need to be aware of.

<p>In most cases, gambling income is taxed at a rate of 25%. However, there are a few exceptions. For example, if you win more than $5,000 in a given year from gambling, then your winnings will be taxed at a rate of 43%. And if you win a jackpot prize worth more than $1 million, then your entire jackpot will be taxed at 43%.</p>
<p>There are also some special rules for Native American tribal casinos. If you gamble at one of these casinos and win more than $5,000 in any given year, then your entire taxable gambling income will be subject to taxation at the rate of 43%.</p>
<p>So what do you need to do to report your gambling income? In most cases, you will need to file Form W-2G with your federal tax return. This form will report the amount of your winnings and provide details on how the tax was calculated.
